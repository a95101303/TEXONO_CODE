Introduction
=============

These codes are for the project of constraining on WIMPs  

without and with  

**Earth Effect Incorporated**

Because we don't know what WIMP is, we assume that it is a kind of "material" that can **interact** with other normal particles on earth.

Here, we need to assume two properties of WIMP:

* Mass(M_{\chi})
* Cross Section

The steps of producing the plots of constraining on WIMPs are as follows:

A. Without the earth effect

At the beginning, we would first consider the cases without the earth effect as our reference.
(You will know more about why I say "reference". You can do it for now and let me explain to you.)
