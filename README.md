# TEXONO_CODE

Hello Everyone! I'm Chih-Hsiang Yeh~

This is the place where I store my codes for my project. 

You can reach me at any time with the mail address: a9510130375@gmail.com

I will reply to you at night mostly.

Introduction
=============

These codes are for the project of constraining on WIMPs  

**Without and With**

**Earth Effect Incorporated**

Because we don't know what WIMP is, we assume that it is a kind of "material" that can **interact** with other normal particles on earth.

Here, we need to assume two properties of WIMP:

* Mass(M_{\chi})
* Cross Section

These two parameters are free ones that should be set ahead for the rest of our research. 

You will see these two again and again in our code. That is the reason.

The steps of producing the plots of constraining on WIMPs are as follows:

A. Without the earth effect

At the beginning, we would first consider the cases without the earth effect as our reference.
(You will know more about why I say "reference". You can do it for now and let me explain to you.)
